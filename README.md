Cargo new but without git integration

# Installation
Download a release from the releases tab. Put it somewhere in your PATH. cd into the folder you want a blank rust project to be created in.
Run    cargnt {path}    and it will create a folder titled {path}, the default Cargo.toml with name: "{path}", and /src/main.rs with "Hello World!".
